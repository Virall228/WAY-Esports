# TODO: Fix SSH Authentication in GitHub Actions Deployment

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed deployment logs and identified SSH authentication failure
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with improved SSH setup:
  - Added SSH key format verification
  - Added SSH connection test before deployment
  - Added detailed troubleshooting tips for common issues

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps
- [ ] Test the updated workflow by pushing to main branch
- [ ] Monitor the deployment logs for any remaining issues
- [ ] If SSH still fails, verify the following on the server:
  - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret contains the full private key (including BEGIN/END lines)
  - Public key is added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server
  - SSH_USER has correct permissions
  - SSH_PORT is correct and SSH service is running

## ðŸ“‹ Troubleshooting Checklist
- [ ] Ensure SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret is properly formatted
- [ ] Verify server accepts public key authentication
- [ ] Check SSH_USER permissions on server
- [ ] Confirm SSH_PORT and SSH_HOST are correct
- [ ] Test SSH connection manually from local machine

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome
After these changes, the deployment should either:
1. Succeed with proper SSH authentication, or
2. Fail with clear error messages indicating exactly what needs to be fixed
