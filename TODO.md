# TODO: Fix SSH Authentication in GitHub Actions Deployment

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed deployment logs and identified SSH authentication failure
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with improved SSH setup:
  - Added SSH key format verification ✅
  - Added SSH connection test before deployment ✅
  - Added detailed troubleshooting tips for common issues ✅

## 🔍 Current Status
- [x] Workflow updated and tested - SSH connection test fails as expected
- [x] Clear error messages and troubleshooting tips are now displayed
- [x] SSH key format validation ✅ working
- [x] SSH connection diagnostics ✅ working

## 🔧 Next Steps to Fix SSH Authentication
- [ ] **Verify GitHub Secrets:**
  - Check `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` contains the full private key (including `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)
  - Verify `SSH_USER`, `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_PORT` are correct
  - Ensure `REPO_PATH` points to the correct directory on server

- [ ] **Server-side Configuration:**
  - Add the corresponding public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server
  - Ensure the SSH user has permissions to access the repository directory
  - Verify SSH service is running and accepting connections

- [ ] **Test SSH Connection Manually:**
  - Generate SSH key pair locally if needed
  - Test connection: `ssh -i private_key user@host -p port`
  - Add public key to server's authorized_keys

## 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist
- [ ] SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret contains full private key with BEGIN/END lines
- [ ] Public key added to server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- [ ] SSH_USER has correct permissions on server
- [ ] SSH_PORT and SSH_HOST are correct
- [ ] SSH service is running on server
- [ ] Repository directory exists and is accessible

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
Once SSH keys are properly configured, the deployment should succeed with:
1. ✅ SSH key format validation
2. ✅ SSH connection test
3. ✅ Successful deployment via SSH
4. ✅ Docker containers updated and running
