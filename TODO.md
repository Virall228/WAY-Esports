# TODO: Finalize Deployment Fixes and Testing

## Completed
- Unified all paths and registry names to lowercase `/opt/way-esports` and `ghcr.io/virall228/way-esports`
- Updated `docker-compose.prod.yml` with:
  - Separate backend and frontend services
  - Correct image names and build contexts
  - Added healthchecks and restart policies
  - Correct env_file path
- Created `.env.example` and `.gitattributes` for environment consistency
- Added `.dockerignore` files to backend and frontend directories
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for multi-service build and push
- Updated `README.md` with consistent deployment instructions

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run full deployment on server and verify all services start without errors
- [ ] Test backend and frontend functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflow triggers and pushes images correctly
- [ ] Clean up any old Docker images with uppercase names on server
- [ ] Confirm healthchecks report services as healthy
- [ ] Address any issues found during testing

## Notes
- Ensure secrets and environment variables are correctly set on the server
- Follow README.md instructions for deployment steps
